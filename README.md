Heroku buildpack: Multi
=======================

I thought, "It would be neat to have a... composable!... buildpack for
Heroku." So I built this. I called my creation heroku-buildpack-multi.

Shortly thereafter I found
https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi which is named the same,
calls itself composable, and uses the same approach in `bin/compile`.  It's
seen real-world use, it has a community, and it was here first.

So I renamed this one heroku-buildpack-multii and barged ahead.
